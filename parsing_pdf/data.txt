Energy Savings Assistance Program which is an energy efficiency program for

income-qualified residential customers.

Important definitions

Rotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to

operational conditions.

Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline

allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during

summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic

needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is

assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As

you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline

allowance will be charged at a higher price.

High Usage: An increased price per kWh whenever electricity usage exceeds four

times the Baseline Allowance (Tier 1) in a billing period. This charge does not apply

to Time-of-Use rate plans.

DWR bond charge: Recovers the cost of bonds issued by the Department of

Water Resources (DWR) to purchase power to serve electric customers during

the California energy crisis. DWR bond charges are collected on behalf of DWR

and do not belong to PG&E.

Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): Ensures that non-exempt

customers under PG&E's GT and ECR rate schedules or who purchase electricity

(generation) from non-PG&E suppliers pay their share of generation costs.

Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated

gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs,

and public-interest research and development.
